Comodo Dragon was a web browser developed by Comodo Group, based on the open-source Chromium project, which also serves as the foundation for Google Chrome. Comodo Dragon aimed to provide enhanced privacy and security features compared to standard Chromium-based browsers. Here are some key aspects of Comodo Dragon:

### Key Features:
1. **Enhanced Privacy**:
   - Comodo Dragon removed certain tracking features present in Google Chrome, such as Google's user tracking and usage statistics.
   - It included options to block cookies and tracking scripts by default.

2. **Security Enhancements**:
   - Integrated with Comodo's security products, offering additional layers of protection against malware and phishing.
   - Included SSL certificate validation to ensure secure connections.

3. **Chromium-Based**:
   - Being based on Chromium, it offered a similar user experience to Google Chrome, including support for Chrome extensions and web standards.

4. **Customizable Settings**:
   - Provided users with more control over privacy settings, such as disabling predictive services and pre-fetching.

5. **VPN Integration**:
   - Comodo Dragon offered optional integration with Comodo's VPN service for additional privacy and security.

### Discontinuation:
Comodo Dragon is no longer actively developed or supported by Comodo Group. The company has shifted its focus to other security products and services. Users looking for a privacy-focused Chromium-based browser may consider alternatives like **Brave Browser**, **Vivaldi**, or **Ungoogled Chromium**.
